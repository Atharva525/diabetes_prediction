# Machine Learning Model with Logistic Regression 

This Jupyter Notebook implements a machine learning pipeline using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes:

- Data preprocessing with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Model training with Logistic Regression and SVM
- Evaluating model accuracy using `accuracy_score`
